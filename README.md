# Outward_LocalizationExampleMod
Mod that can be used as an example for localizing other mods.

The contents of the "Faeryn-LocalizationExampleMod" folder go into your zip package, following the official package structure: https://thunderstore.io/package/create/docs/

Or if you are not uploading to Thunderstore, just want to use your translation locally, then copy the folder itself into your `BepInEx/plugins` folder (or r2modman equivalent).
